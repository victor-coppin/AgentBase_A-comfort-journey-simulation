# Agent-Based Urban Comfort Simulation

A NetLogo model simulating traffic comfort for cars and bikes in a city grid.  
It explores how infrastructure like bike lanes impacts the travel efficiency and frustration of different agents.

## Features
- Fixed originâ€“destination routing
- Comfort score = efficiency + frustration
- Dynamic sliders for traffic density, bike-lane preference, and frustration
- Ghost agents for ideal trip benchmarking
- Switchable road segments for testing impact
